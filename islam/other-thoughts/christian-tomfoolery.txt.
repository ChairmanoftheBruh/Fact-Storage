"When Jesus died on the cross, which nature died"
They'll usually say the human part, duh!
"Okay, so is his human part separate or distinct from the divinity?" (this is known as nestorianism)
No, no no, the divinity and humanity are the same person
"Did the one person of Jesus die on the cross, yes or no?"
Yes, but not the divine part
repeat, repeat
and just press them on this until they get the memo
lol
then they'll say "the human part didn't die"
so it's like, akin to Islam then.
They have the Muslim view
They'd have to say "Jesus is one person, but this one part of him didn't really die, just this other part" but that's heretical, he's not made of parts in Orthodoxy.
So, you press them, "the ONE person, did he die"
they can't answer it

According to Mark 15:25, "And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.” 
According to John 19:14-16 "And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour: and he (Pilate) saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. Then delivered he him over therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away."

In Matthew 27:46 Jesus’ last words were "Eli, Eli, lama sabachtani?" My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?

Luke indicates in verse 24:10 that there were at least two others. 
According to John 20:1-4, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone, saw the stone removed, ran to find Peter, and returned to the tomb with Peter and another disciple.

In Matthew 27:5 Judas hangs himself while in Acts 1:18 he bursts open and his insides spill out.

“You will find a people (monks) who claim to have totally given themselves to Allah. Leave them to what they claim to have given themselves” (….) “Do not kill women or children or an aged, infirm person. Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees. Do not destroy an inhabited place. Do not slaughter sheep or camels except for food. Do not burn bees and do not scatter them” – Muwatta Malik (21/10)
